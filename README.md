## Motivation

As volunteers, we love the feeling of togetherness when doing something good for the community. We get to meet new people, make a meaningful impact in our world, and be part of a community of volunteers. This fostering of a good-willed community usually starts from the “join” button on the WhatsApp community. We love being able to chat, build personal connections, and the convenience of asking a question simply by sending a quick message.

However, as a volunteer organizer, there is more work that has to be done behind the scenes. While we love being able to connect with our volunteers, it is often a time-consuming process. On top of being in the moment and ensuring everything stays on track, tracking attendance during volunteer events can be especially inconvenient when volunteers may come late or leave early. Furthermore, when we come back home, we have to ensure that everyone on our list is emailed a certificate to thank them for their contribution. In order to improve, we also want to take a look at the event analytics and know what our volunteers are skilled at, what they do, and what they like. But to compile this data, it might take another week's worth of work on top of my full-time job. It is indeed a lot of work that lacks appreciation.

We wanted to make a solution for both parties. To keep the personal and warm community built on a chat interface but to equip it with all the features administrators need to save time and cost. This provides the familiar interface users from 13-65 may be used with all features administrators may need. This includes data tracking, attendance, and more.

Unlike other similar apps (Rostify, Volgistics) in the market, Heartline is specifically catered to volunteers who are not very technologically savvy and want an easy-to-use platform. Administrators will be able to enjoy the benefit of having access to features while fostering a warm community.

## Vision

We hope to develop an app that enables administrators to collaborate with volunteers in selecting a cause that is suitable and aligns with their interests. Our proposed app aims to help volunteers efficiently manage data, track attendance, schedule, and issue certificates while fostering a warm community.
